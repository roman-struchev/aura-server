# aura-server

Backend for [aura-pad](https://github.com/roman-struchev/aura-pad)'s Work Together
feature, running at [aura.struchev.site](https://aura.struchev.site).

## Work Together backend

Implements the **Work Together** collaborative-editing backend contract specified in
[`docs/edit-together/specification.md`](https://github.com/roman-struchev/aura-pad/blob/main/docs/edit-together/specification.md)
of the [aura-pad](https://github.com/roman-struchev/aura-pad) editor
(see also [`feature-desc.md`](https://github.com/roman-struchev/aura-pad/blob/main/docs/edit-together/feature-desc.md)
for the product framing). In short: AuraPad shares an open file by creating a
*session* here and minting a time-limited *link*; whoever opens that link — no
AuraPad install needed — gets a live Monaco editor synced over Yjs, relayed
through this server.

What's implemented, under `src/main/java/com/struchev/auraserver/worktogether/`:

- **REST API** (`/v1/sessions/...`) — create session, mint/revoke share links,
  end session, get status (spec §3). Everything but session creation requires
  `Authorization: Bearer <hostToken>` for that session.
- **WebSocket relay** (`/v1/sessions/{sessionId}/connect`) — relays Yjs sync +
  awareness frames between the Host and guests, enforces read-only links
  server-side, and closes sockets with the spec's close codes on
  expiry/revocation/session end (spec §4, §5).
- **Guest-facing editor page** (`/j/{linkId}`) — a self-hosted Monaco +
  `y-websocket` + `y-monaco` page (source in `frontend/work-together-guest/`,
  built assets in `src/main/resources/static/work-together/`); see that
  directory's own notes for the rebuild command.
- Signed, opaque tokens (HMAC-SHA256) carry role/session/link claims — no
  accounts, matching the spec's "possession of the link" trust model.
- In-memory only: sessions/links/connections live in process memory and are
  swept on TTL expiry; nothing is durably persisted (spec §7/§8).

## Landing page

`/` serves a short static page (`src/main/resources/static/index.html`)
describing the AuraPad project with a link to its GitHub repo.

## Configuration

| Property | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `worktogether.token-secret` (env `WORKTOGETHER_TOKEN_SECRET`) | random at startup | HMAC key signing tokens; set this for tokens to survive a restart |
| `worktogether.public-base-url` (env `WORKTOGETHER_PUBLIC_BASE_URL`) | derived from the request | Pin share/join links to one fixed host instead of the reverse proxy's forwarded headers |
| `worktogether.max-session-ttl-seconds` | `2592000` (30 days) | Hard ceiling on `maxTtlSeconds`; matches AuraPad's own `MAX_TTL_SECONDS` |
| `worktogether.cleanup-interval-seconds` | `30` | How often expired sessions/links are swept |
| `worktogether.rate-limit.max-per-minute` | `30` | Per-IP cap on `POST /v1/sessions` |

## Running

```
./gradlew bootRun
```

Deployment is via the existing GitHub Actions workflow
(`.github/workflows/gradlew-publish-and-deploy.yml`) → Docker Hub → the
`docker-compose.yml` on the target host.
